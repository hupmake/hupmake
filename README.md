I'm Hupmake!

I mostly write in Python and Bash and will put up new
code when I get around to writing it! Being a professional
Linux System Engineer and dad doesn't leave me much time
for extracurricular coding, but that's okay!

I also play guitar, bass, sing, and want to learn drums
when I get a kit!
